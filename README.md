# ColorGameDDR
This game is based on the Stroop test in which you have to say the color of the word (not the actual word itself). Players use a foot controlled input device (a DDR pad) to physically choose the correct color. Footpresses are sent as keypresses to the computer via a PS2 to USB adapter.
